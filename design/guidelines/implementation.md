# Implementation Guidelines

## Frontend Development

These guidelines help ensure consistent implementation of the design system across the Patient Advocacy Platform.

### React Component Implementation

1. **Component Structure**
   - Use functional components with hooks
   - Implement proper prop typing with TypeScript
   - Add appropriate defaultProps and prop validation
   - Prefer composition over inheritance
   - Create small, focused components

2. **Component Organization**
   - Organize components by feature and function
   - Use a consistent file structure for components:
     ```
     ComponentName/
     ├── index.ts                # Export component
     ├── ComponentName.tsx       # Main component code
     ├── ComponentName.test.tsx  # Component tests
     └── ComponentName.module.css # Component-specific styles (if needed)
     ```

3. **Styling Implementation**
   - Use Tailwind CSS as the primary styling approach
   - Extract common patterns into components
   - Use @apply for complex recurring patterns
   - Maintain the design token system

4. **State Management**
   - Use Redux for global application state
   - Use local component state for UI-specific state
   - Use React Context for theme and shared component state

### Accessibility Implementation

1. **Semantic HTML**
   - Use proper HTML elements (button, nav, header, etc.)
   - Structure content with appropriate heading levels
   - Use HTML landmarks (main, section, article)

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Implement logical tab order
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Provide visible focus indicators

3. **ARIA Attributes**
   - Add ARIA roles where HTML semantics are insufficient
   - Implement aria-label for elements without visible text
   - Use aria-expanded, aria-pressed for interactive elements
   - Implement aria-live regions for dynamic content

4. **Screen Reader Support**
   - Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA)
   - Provide alternative text for images
   - Hide decorative elements from screen readers
   - Announce form validation errors

### Responsive Implementation

1. **Mobile-First Approach**
   - Start with mobile layouts and progressively enhance
   - Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)
   - Test on actual devices when possible

2. **Breakpoint Usage**
   - Follow the defined breakpoint system
   - Avoid creating custom breakpoints unless absolutely necessary
   - Handle edge cases for ultra-small and ultra-large screens

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize images for different screen sizes
   - Lazy load off-screen content
   - Minimize layout shifts during loading
   - Consider reduced data usage for mobile

## Design-Development Collaboration

1. **Design Handoff**
   - Use the design system as the source of truth
   - Discuss implementation details early
   - Clarify animations and interactions

2. **Design Review**
   - Regular design reviews during implementation
   - Check implementation against design specifications
   - Validate responsive behavior

3. **Design System Maintenance**
   - Document all component variations
   - Keep the design system documentation updated
   - Establish a process for adding new components

## Quality Assurance

1. **Browser Testing**
   - Test across major browsers:
     - Chrome
     - Firefox
     - Safari
     - Edge
   - Ensure consistent appearance and behavior

2. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Automated testing with tools like axe
   - Manual testing with screen readers
   - Keyboard navigation testing
   - Color contrast validation

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Core Web Vitals measurement
   - Lighthouse performance audits
   - Load time optimization
   - Bundle size monitoring
