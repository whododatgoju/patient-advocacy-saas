# Frontend Development Plan: Patient Advocacy Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for the Patient Advocacy Platform frontend, which is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The frontend serves as the primary interface for patients, advocates, and healthcare providers, offering a comprehensive set of features to support patient advocacy workflows.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **State Management**: Redux with Redux Toolkit
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **API Communication**: Axios

## Component Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture with the following hierarchy:

```
src/
├── assets/           # Static assets
├── components/       # Reusable UI components
│   ├── common/       # Generic UI elements
│   ├── layout/       # Layout components
│   └── feature/      # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── pages/            # Page components
├── redux/            # Redux store, slices, and selectors
├── services/         # API services
├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/            # Utility functions
```

## Key Pages and Features

1. **HomePage**
   - Hero section
   - Feature highlights
   - Testimonials
   - Call-to-action sections

2. **DashboardPage**
   - User-specific dashboard (different views for patients, advocates, providers)
   - Recent activity
   - Quick action buttons
   - Analytics and insights

3. **ProfilePage**
   - User profile management
   - Preference settings
   - Account security options

4. **ResourcesPage**
   - Comprehensive resource library
   - Filtering by category
   - Search functionality
   - Saved resources

5. **AdvocateMatchPage**
   - Matching interface for patients to find advocates
   - Filtering and search options
   - Advocate profiles

## Role-Based UI

The UI adapts based on user roles:

| Feature | Patient | Advocate | Provider |
|---------|---------|----------|----------|
| Dashboard | Health metrics, appointments, resources | Case management, client list, resources | Patient list, advocacy requests, clinical tools |
| Profile | Personal health information, preferences | Professional information, specializations | Clinical credentials, practice information |
| Resources | Health education, support groups | Clinical guidelines, advocacy resources | Evidence-based resources, protocol information |

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Current)

- Setup project structure with Vite and TypeScript
- Implement authentication flow
- Create layout components
- Establish Redux store structure
- Setup API service layer

### Phase 2: Primary Interfaces

- Develop HomePage
- Implement DashboardPage with role-based views
- Create ProfilePage with complete user management
- Build ResourcesPage with filtering and search

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Implement AdvocateMatchPage
- Add real-time notifications
- Integrate messaging functionality
- Develop analytics dashboards

### Phase 4: Polish and Optimization

- Accessibility audit and improvements
- Performance optimization
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile responsiveness refinement

## Integration with Operations Infrastructure

The frontend development will leverage the operations infrastructure in the following ways:

1. **CI/CD**: Use the GitHub Actions workflows in `/operations/ci-cd/github-actions/` for automated testing and deployment
2. **Monitoring**: Integrate with Prometheus metrics in `/operations/monitoring/prometheus/` for frontend performance tracking
3. **Logging**: Implement structured logging that integrates with the Logstash configuration in `/operations/logging/logstash/`
4. **Security**: Apply the security scanning for dependencies as defined in `/operations/security/scanning/`
5. **Deployment**: Utilize the Kubernetes deployment configuration in `/operations/infrastructure/kubernetes/` for scalable hosting

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: For individual components and utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: For component interactions and Redux integration
- **E2E Tests**: For critical user flows
- **Accessibility Tests**: To ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance
- **Performance Tests**: For loading and interaction benchmarks

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Branching**: Each new feature is developed in a dedicated branch
2. **Pull Requests**: Code review process before merging to develop branch
3. **CI Verification**: Automated tests run on pull requests
4. **Staging Deployment**: Features are deployed to staging for UAT
5. **Production Release**: Scheduled releases to production

## Next Steps

1. Complete the core authentication components
2. Implement the Dashboard page with role-based views
3. Develop the resource library components
4. Create the advocate matching interface
5. Integrate with the backend API services
