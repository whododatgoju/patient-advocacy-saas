# Development Roadmap: Patient Advocacy Platform

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the strategic development plan for the Patient Advocacy Platform over the next 18 months. Based on comprehensive user research and persona development, we've identified a phased approach that balances technical feasibility, user needs, and resource constraints. The roadmap is designed to deliver incremental value while building toward a comprehensive ecosystem that serves patients, advocates, and healthcare providers.

## Strategic Objectives

1. **Bridge Information Gaps**: Connect patients with accurate, personalized health information
2. **Facilitate Meaningful Advocacy**: Empower advocates with tools to provide effective support
3. **Integrate with Healthcare**: Create seamless connections to clinical workflows
4. **Address Equity Barriers**: Ensure platform accessibility across the digital divide
5. **Protect Patient Privacy**: Implement privacy-by-design principles throughout
