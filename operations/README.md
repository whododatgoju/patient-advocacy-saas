## Getting Started

1. Review the `setup_guide.md` to understand the development environment setup
2. Explore the implementation guides for web and mobile application development
3. Use the infrastructure code in `/infrastructure` to provision resources
4. Set up CI/CD pipelines using the configurations in `/ci-cd`
5. Configure monitoring and alerting using files in `/monitoring`

## Operations Workflow

1. Infrastructure is defined as code in the `/infrastructure` directory
2. Changes are deployed via CI/CD pipelines defined in `/ci-cd`
3. Monitoring and logging configurations track system health
4. Runbooks in `/docs/runbooks` provide guidance for common operational tasks
5. Backup scripts ensure data integrity and disaster recovery capabilities
