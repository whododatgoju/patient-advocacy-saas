# Healthcare Provider Personas: 2024-2025

## Overview
These healthcare provider personas represent key medical professionals who will interact with the Patient Advocacy Platform. Understanding their workflows, challenges, and goals is essential for developing effective integration points and collaboration features. These personas enable us to design a platform that enhances rather than disrupts clinical workflows while facilitating better patient advocacy.
